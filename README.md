# EVE#

## What

This is a wrapper for the [EVE Swagger Interface](https://esi.evetech.net)

## Why

As far as I know, this is the first in C#

## Currently Being Worked on or Completed

- [x] Models
- [x] OAuth2
- [ ] Wrappers
- [ ] Testing

## Plans

### Static Data Import

Mostly to avoid hitting the "Search" and "Universe" endpoints for data which can be searched in the static data export. I want to do this automatically.

### Third Party API Integration

Surrounding this game, there have been APIs surrounding the ESI. These probably should be supported because often times, they fulfill the niche that they serve better than the ESI.

## Issues

Submit a github issue, I'll figure something out regarding templates later.

## How

There are probably people calling me a heretic for using structs instead of classes. Get over it, if you want to change it, fork it, I don't care.

## Support From the Developer

Discord is probably the best. I am T3CHN01200#7178 on discord. Aside from that, I am both in Oz' and the Fuzzwork Enterprises discord servers. Those are probably the most appropriate places to contact me.

## Support the Project

If you want to send an ISK/PLEX donation, send to "Fomanko Berodald" in EVE Online on Tranquility.
